# Onur is my Name, and WEB DEV is the Game!
---
born and raised in **Hamburg, Germany**, <br>
I like to travel around the Globe and meet new people in the Techworld. <br> 
I'm easy going and like to joke around with punchlines, <br> 
**but** <br>
I'm reliable and professional when it comes to deadlines.

## My Techstack (for now):
+ **Html**
+ **CSS (styled components)**
+ **JavaScript (React/Next.js)**
---

## I'm trilingual (for now):
+ **German**
+ **English**
+ **Turkish**

**Funfact:**
_Onur means **Honor** in turkish, and it's an honor for me that you found your way to my Github._ :)
