# Onur is my Name, and WEB DEV is the Game. <br> I like to level up at least regularly. <br> Let's go for a few Quests together!

I'm easy going and like to joke around, <br> 
but reliable and professional when it comes to deadlines.

I'm a good addition to every team (especially a WEB DEV team), <br> 
dont believe me? <br>
**Let me prove it to you!** <br>
How you may ask? <br>
**That's a very good Question!** <br>
Either I show you my skills in a internship, <br> 
or you fall in love with my portfolio and hire me right away. <br>
**ItÂ´s your choise my future friend.** <br>
