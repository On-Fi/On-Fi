# Onur is my Name, and WEB DEV is the Game. <br> I like to level up at least regularly. <br> Let's go for a few Quests together!
---
born and raised in **Hamburg, Germany**, <br>
I like to travel around the Globe and meet new people in the Techworld. <br> 
I'm easy going and like to joke around with punchlines, <br> 
but reliable and professional when it comes to deadlines.

## My Techstack (for now):
+ **Html**
+ **CSS (styled components)**
+ **JavaScript (React/Next.js)**
---

## I'm trilingual (for now):
+ **German**
+ **English**
+ **Turkish**

**Funfact:**
_Onur means **Honor** in turkish, and it's an honor for me that you found your way to my Github._ :)

I'm a good addition to every team (especially a WEB DEV team), <br> 
dont believe me? <br>
**Let me prove it to you!** <br>
How you may ask? <br>
**That's a very good Question!** <br>
Either I show you my skills in a internship, <br> 
or you fall in love with my portfolio and hire me right away. <br>
**ItÂ´s your choise my future friend.** <br>
